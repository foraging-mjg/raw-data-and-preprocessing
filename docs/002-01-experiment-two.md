# (PART) Experiment Two {-}

# Introduction

Contents

In experiment 2, n trials. Task.

We manipulated two factors: one within-subjects (Resource Distribution) with two levels: 'clumped' and 'random'; and one between-subjects (Fading) with two levels 'fade' and 'no-fade'. The fade condition differeed from experiment 1 in that once a tree had been visited, it was thereafter displayed faded out such that it was apparent to the participant which trees had been visited previously and which had not. The no-fade condition was the same as experiment 1. We expected that the fading would function as a memory aid and reduce revisits as well as making the task easier overall on the other metrics.

We created ?? random stimuli in which the ?? target fruit items were uniformly distributed about the ?? trees (random condition) and ?? stimuli in which all ?? target fruit items were arranged in one large area (clumped condition) that covered either the left or the right side of the layout.
